# Machine Learning (GISC 6323)

## Course Overview

This course, taught by Dr. Michael Tiefelsdorf, focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to socio-economic and georeferenced data. Students learn both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, model evaluation, and the ethical implications of machine learning.

## Machine Learning Course Labs

This repository contains the lab assignments for the Machine Learning course (GISC 6323). Each lab focuses on different aspects of machine learning and data analysis. Below are the descriptions of each lab along with the associated files and key activities.

## Lab 1: Understanding the Variance and Bias Trade-off

**Description:** In this lab, we explored the trade-offs between variance and bias in predictive modeling. The lab involved working with simulated data to understand how different levels of model complexity impact the variance and bias of the model's predictions.

**Key Activities:**
- Implemented various polynomial regression models.
- Evaluated the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to understand the trade-off between bias and variance.
- Visualized the results to illustrate the concept of the bias-variance trade-off.

**Files:**
- **MSEVarBias.R:** Script to implement and evaluate polynomial regression models.
- **MSEVarBiasStructure.R:** Script providing the structure for bias-variance analysis.
- **findClusters.r:** Script for clustering data points.

## Lab 2: K-means Clustering and PCA

**Description:** This lab focused on implementing K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The goal was to group similar data points and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for better visualization and analysis.

**Key Activities:**
- Applied K-means clustering to a dataset to identify distinct groups.
- Used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible.
- Visualized the clustering results and principal components.

**Files:**
- **Lab02_Jim.pdf:** Detailed report on the implementation and results.
- **SampleAnswerLab02SP2023.rmd:** Sample RMarkdown file with answers and analysis.
